# Lesson 6

## Arithmetic operators

Here are the airthmetic operators we will work with

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Modulus (%)
* Increment (++)
* Decrement (--)

In the included `index.js` file, declare a variable called `myNumber`. Assign the value of 100 to it. Declare another variable called `myOtherNumber` and assign the value of 3 to it. Both are numeric variables.

Lets add the two numbers together and print the product.

```js
console.log(myNumber+myOtherNumber)
```

What did get printed?

Let's subtract the smaller value from the larger value print the product. 

Let's multiply myNumber by myOtherNumber and print the product.

Let's divide smaller number by larger number and print the product.

Let's calculate the division remainder (modulus) of myNumber by myOtherNumber.

Increment and decrement are performed on a single variable, like

```js
myNumber++
```

or 

```js
myOtherNumber--
```

Add these statements to index.js and print the value of both variables.
