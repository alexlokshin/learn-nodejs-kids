# Lesson 1

Create a console application that prints `Hello, world!`

* Try it in the node interpeter first. Run `node` from the terminal. When the caret appears, type in:

`console.log("Hello, world!)"`

This should print
```
Hello, world!
undefined
```

* Now, let's create a node application and run it. To get started, create a file called `index.js` in this folder, add the following content to it:

```js
console.log("Hello, world!")
```

Save the file and run it from the command line.

```
node index.js
```

You should see the following:

```
Hello, world!
```
